cleanvbase2
###########

Cleans up a VBASE2 Fasta file to produce a file with identifiers using
standard gene names instead of VBASE2's own identifiers.

Also allows only proper genes to be selected (discarding pseudogenes, 
etc.) and also only one example of each gene where there are allelic
variants.

Run with 

      cleanvbase2 -h

for help.
